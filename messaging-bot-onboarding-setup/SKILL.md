# Messaging-bot onboarding setup

A cold handle DMs a number → the app greets, gets consent, provisions a handle-anchored
account, and hands off. Every platform delivers those inbounds to an HTTP webhook that must
**authenticate the delivery** before acting. The auth is always the same shape — and the same
shape fails the same way in production.

## The shared-secret pattern (learn this first)

Each provider signs its webhook deliveries with a secret **you** configure in their dashboard/API.
It arrives in a request header. The app compares it (constant-time) to a secret in its own deployed
env. Match → process; mismatch/absent → **401**.

**The #1 production failure: the provider's secret field is left EMPTY.** Then the provider sends
**no** header (or an empty one), the app compares it against a non-empty deployed secret, and it
**401s every real inbound** — while your synthetic tests pass, because your test sends the deployed
secret in the header. Symptom: "the bot never replies," webhook is registered, no errors visible,
but zero onboarding rows in the DB.

**Fix:** generate ONE secret, set it on **both** sides — the app env (all deploy targets) **and**
the provider dashboard field. If either side is empty or they differ, every inbound 401s.

| Platform | Secret header (provider → app) | Where you set it (provider side) | App env var |
|---|---|---|---|
| iMessage (Sendblue) | `sb-signing-secret` | Sendblue dashboard → Webhooks → **Global Secret** (or per-webhook Secret). Optional field → often left blank → 401. | `SENDBLUE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| Telegram | `x-telegram-bot-api-secret-token` | `setWebhook` call, `secret_token` param | `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| WhatsApp (Cloud API) | GET verify: `hub.verify_token`; POST auth: `x-hub-signature-256` (HMAC-SHA256 of body) | Meta app → WhatsApp → Configuration → Webhook: **Verify token** field (matches env); the HMAC key is the **App Secret** (App settings → Basic) | `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` (handshake) + `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` (HMAC) |

Generate + deploy a shared secret (Cloudflare Workers example — see the companion
`set-messaging-webhook-secret.sh` in pooriaarab/scripts):

```bash
SECRET="sbwh_$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
# app side: env file + every worker that serves the webhook
# ...edit .env.local, then:
printf '%s' "$SECRET" | npx wrangler secret put SENDBLUE_WEBHOOK_SECRET --name <staging-worker>
printf '%s' "$SECRET" | npx wrangler secret put SENDBLUE_WEBHOOK_SECRET --name <prod-worker>
# provider side: paste $SECRET into the dashboard field and SAVE
```

## Telegram: the bare-`/start` cold-onboarding gap

Telegram's **Start button sends exactly `/start`** (no payload). A common webhook shape intercepts
any `/start` and routes it to the *connect* deep-link handler, which for a bare `/start` replies a
static "go to Settings to connect" help and returns — so a brand-new user **never reaches
conversational onboarding**. Onboarding then only fires if the user's *first* message is non-`/start`
text, which real users don't do.

**Route `/start` to the connect handler only when it carries a deep-link payload (`/start <code>`)
OR the chat is not private.** A **bare `/start` in a private chat** must fall through to the normal
dispatch, which routes an unknown handle into onboarding and a linked chat to the agent. (iMessage
has no `/start` equivalent — its first inbound text goes straight to onboarding, so it's unaffected.
Audit Slack/Discord/WhatsApp for the same "command/help intercept returns before onboarding" shape.)

## WhatsApp: create or reuse the Meta app

- **Reuse over create.** WhatsApp is a **use case** you add to an existing app under the same
  business portfolio, not necessarily a new app. developers.facebook.com/apps → open an app in the
  business → Dashboard → **Add use cases** → **"Connect with customers through WhatsApp"** → Save.
  Adding the use case is clean (no ToS wall); the ToS gate comes at Step 1.
- **Step 1 "Try it out" — test number.** Provisions a throwaway number + temp token (max 5
  recipients, token expires). Clicking **Continue** here **accepts** "Facebook Terms for WhatsApp
  Business" + "Meta Hosting Terms for Cloud API" — a terms acceptance, so get explicit user
  authorization first. The free test number can silently fail to provision if the business portfolio
  has no verified payment method — don't loop on the Claim button; it's a Meta-side gate.
- **Step 2 "Production setup"** — register a **real** phone number + generate a **permanent System
  User access token** (the temp token is useless for prod).
- **Step 3 "Business verification"** — required for production messaging; can take days. User-gated.
- **The 5 env vars the app needs** (owner-supplied): `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`,
  `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID` (both non-secret IDs, from WhatsApp → API Setup),
  `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` (permanent System User token), `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` (App settings →
  Basic), `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` (you invent it; must match the webhook Verify token field).
- Graph API version pins in code (e.g. `v25.0`); callback URL is the app's
  `/api/v1/integrations/whatsapp/webhook`. The Phone Number ID is **not** the phone number — it's a
  separate numeric ID on the API Setup page.

## e2e-verify a bot for real (don't trust a 200)

A registered webhook returning `{ok:true}` proves nothing about onboarding. Verify the whole chain:

1. **Synthetic signed POST** to the *deployed* webhook, mimicking a real cold inbound, with the
   secret header set to the deployed secret. Use a clearly-fake external id you can clean up.
2. **Check the DB**, not the HTTP status: query the onboarding-state table for a row keyed on
   `(source, external_id)`. A row (e.g. `step=awaiting_choice`) proves dispatch → onboarding ran.
   No row after a 200 = the chain no-ops somewhere (an intercept, a wrong env, or prod behind main).
3. **Negative test:** same POST with a wrong secret must **401**.
4. **Right environment:** onboarding merged to `main` deploys to **staging** automatically; **prod**
   often deploys from a `release` branch and can lag. A real inbound hits prod — if prod predates
   the onboarding merge, prod drops cold users silently even though staging works. Check the row on
   the env the webhook actually points at.
5. **Clean up** your synthetic rows afterward (`DELETE ... WHERE external_id IN (...)`).

Example (Telegram, private chat, plain text triggers onboarding; `/start` may not — see the gap
above):

```bash
SECRET=$(grep -E '^TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=' .env.local | cut -d= -f2-)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST "https://<host>/api/v1/integrations/telegram/webhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-telegram-bot-api-secret-token: ${SECRET}" \
  -d '{"update_id":99900001,"message":{"message_id":1,"date":1,"chat":{"id":99900001,"type":"private","first_name":"E2E"},"from":{"id":99900001,"is_bot":false,"first_name":"E2E"},"text":"hi"}}'
# then: wrangler d1 execute <db> --remote --command \
#   "SELECT source,external_id,step FROM bot_onboarding_state WHERE external_id='99900001';"
```

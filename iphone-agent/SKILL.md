## Gates

- Do one named action.
- **Warmup scripts** override the interaction gates below (they perform likes, comments, DMs, follows intentionally). The gates remain for one-off manual tasks.
- Stop before send, post, comment, like, share, follow, call, pay, delete, sign-in, password, erase, or a permission grant (unless called via `warmup-*` scripts).
- Read the frame after every gesture. The first frame can still show the old screen. Wait, then save again, before you call the gesture a miss.
- A click in the dark area leaves the app switcher onto the screen behind it. That screen can be the home screen, an open folder, or App Library.
- Do not loop a feed.
- The pointer is AssistiveTouch and apps can see it.
- Do not restart the server.
- Stay off the AssistiveTouch button.
- Raw `home` only parks the pointer. Do not trust a home swipe until the frame shows the home screen. A slow drag from the bottom opens the app switcher.
- A full iPhone is not claimed until the round pointer moves on that phone.

## Scope

- Send storage questions to org-iphone-storage.
- Some3C and Novatek boards are out of scope.

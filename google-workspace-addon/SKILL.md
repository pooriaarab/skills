# Building a Google Workspace add-on

A Workspace add-on is **server-side Apps Script (`.gs`) that renders CardService cards in
the host sidebar** (Docs, Sheets, …). No frontend, no DOM, no Node — you write trigger
functions that return cards. Source lives in `integrations/google-workspace-addon/`. It
is a thin client over your own public REST API: CardService renders the UI, `UrlFetchApp`
calls the API with a Bearer key. Read this before the first file; the command-level
playbook is `pooriaarab/scripts` `scripts/google-workspace-addon/README.md`.

## When to use

- **Triggers:** 'build a Google Workspace add-on', 'Apps Script CardService', 'appsscript.json oauthScopes', 'publish to the Google Workspace Marketplace', 'UrlFetchApp can't reach my API', 'OAuth verification rejected', 'clasp push', 'Google Workspace Marketplace SDK'.
- No fetch in Apps Script: UrlFetchApp needs the script.external_request scope and a urlFetchWhitelist entry. oauthScopes must match across manifest, consent screen and code.
- Homepage triggers return Cards; action handlers return ActionResponses. User keys go in user properties, not script properties. The real wall is Google's OAuth verification (demo video, days to weeks), not the listing form.
- Siblings: canva-app, adobe-express-addon, figma-plugin, shopify-app, connector-directory-submission.

## The trap that wastes a day: there is no `fetch`

Apps Script has **no `fetch`, no Node APIs, no async/await** — every call is synchronous
and every external request goes through `UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options)`. Three hard
requirements ride on that one call:

1. **Scope.** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request` must be in
   `oauthScopes` in `appsscript.json` or the fetch is refused at runtime.
2. **Whitelist.** Add your API origin to `urlFetchWhitelist` (HTTPS URL prefixes,
   trailing `/`) in the manifest. Technically optional, but reviewers ask for it and it
   pins the add-on to your domain.
3. **Errors.** Set `muteHttpExceptions: true` or `UrlFetchApp` **throws** on any non-2xx
   and you never see the API's error body.

**Rule:** before debugging "my API call fails," confirm all three — scope in the
manifest, origin in the whitelist, `muteHttpExceptions` set. A missing one looks like a
generic authorization failure, not a network error.

## The other traps (each cost a round-trip)

1. **oauthScopes must match in three places** — `appsscript.json`, the GCP OAuth consent
   screen, and what the code actually calls. A mismatch gives users an "unverified app"
   wall or an auth error. Prefer `.currentonly` host scopes (`documents.currentonly`,
   `spreadsheets.currentonly`) — full `documents`/`drive` scopes drag you into
   restricted-scope verification.
2. **Triggers return Cards; action handlers return ActionResponses.** A
   `homepageTrigger.runFunction` must `return CardService.newCardBuilder()….build()`. A
   button's `setFunctionName(…)` handler must return
   `CardService.newActionResponseBuilder()` with navigation/notification. Return the
   wrong type and the sidebar fails with no useful error.
3. **User keys live in user properties.** `PropertiesService.getUserProperties()` is
   per-user; `getScriptProperties()` is shared by every user of the add-on. Store the API
   key in user properties — script properties leak one user's key to all.
4. **Deploy ≠ edit.** The Marketplace listing points at a **versioned deployment ID**
   (Deploy → New deployment → Add-on). `clasp push` changes nothing users see until you
   create a new deployment version. During development use **Deploy → Test deployments**
   to install into Docs/Sheets.
5. **The default GCP project is a dead end.** An Apps Script project starts on a hidden
   auto-created GCP project; you cannot fully configure the OAuth consent screen or the
   Marketplace SDK there. Switch to a standard GCP project you own first (Project
   Settings → Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project → Change project).

## Build path

- Develop with **clasp** (`@google/clasp`): `clasp login`, `clasp create --type
  standalone`, `clasp push` (pushes `appsscript.json` + all `.gs` files), `clasp open`.
  Or paste the files into `script.google.com` and enable the manifest via Project
  Settings → "Show appsscript.json in editor".
- Manifest (`appsscript.json`): `addOns.common` (`name`, `logoUrl`, `layoutProperties`,
  `homepageTrigger`, `universalActions`) + per-host blocks (`addOns.docs`,
  `addOns.sheets`) with their own homepage triggers, plus `oauthScopes` and
  `urlFetchWhitelist`.
- UI: CardService builders only — card sections, widgets,
  `CardService.newAction().setFunctionName(…)`. No HTML.
- API: one thin `UrlFetchApp` client over your public REST API. Keep business logic
  server-side; the add-on renders and relays.

## Submission — Google Workspace Marketplace

**Submittable: portal-review** (Google Cloud console; OAuth verification is the heavy gate). Steps:

1. Switch the script to a standard GCP project (trap 5).
2. Configure the **OAuth consent screen** (External for public distribution). Add the
   exact scopes from `appsscript.json`.
3. Enable the **Google Workspace Marketplace SDK** in `console.cloud.google.com`.
4. **App Configuration tab:** check Google Workspace Add-on + the host extensions, enter
   the **deployment ID** (Deploy → New deployment → Add-on in the Apps Script editor),
   fill developer name, website, support email; set visibility **Public**.
5. **Store Listing tab:** app name, short + detailed descriptions, graphics (128×128 app
   icon, 220×140 tile card, 1280×800 or 640×400 screenshots), category, pricing,
   terms-of-service and privacy-policy URLs.
6. **OAuth verification.** Public listings with sensitive scopes must pass Google's
   verification: submit from the consent-screen page with a **demo video** of the add-on
   flow. This takes days to weeks and bounces on any scope/consent mismatch (exact video
   + timeline requirements: TBD — confirm at first submission).
7. **Publish** in the Marketplace SDK. Google reviews the listing (days, not minutes).

For domain-internal use, set visibility **Private** in step 4 — no OAuth verification, no
marketplace review.

## Parity checklist (prove in real Docs + Sheets before submitting)

install via Test deployments · save the API key from a clean state · read the current
doc/sheet · call the API · see success/error surfaced in a card · refresh.

# LinkedIn Ads

LinkedIn Ads has a self-serve ad account and a real Conversions API. Create and
associate a conversion rule, then send confirmed events.

Use [ad-conversion-hub](../ad-conversion-hub/SKILL.md) for the canonical event
envelope, consent gate, identity rules, retry policy, and adapter contract.
## Account and access

Campaign Manager is self-serve. Select **For Business → Advertise** in
LinkedIn, then create an ad account. A Business Manager account requires an
admin. The creator gets account manager and billing admin access. Currency and
Company Page cannot change later; a Company Page is required for full features.
See [Create an ad account](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a422205).

For a direct advertiser integration, use **Data → Signals Manager → Direct API
→ Generate access token**. This route needs no developer application. The
token does not expire and appears once. Store it at once. See [CAPI access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/conversions/getting-access-conversions?view=li-lms-2026-08).

For a product serving several advertisers, request the Conversions API product
for a developer app. LinkedIn reviews the business details and use case. A Page
super admin must verify the app. Partner OAuth uses `rw_conversions` and
`r_ads`; the member needs a non-`VIEWER` role. See [partner access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/conversions/getting-access-conversions?view=li-lms-2026-08) and [the API workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/conversions/conversions-workflow?view=li-lms-2026-08).

LinkedIn defines no environment-variable names. This skill uses the hub
convention:

```text
LINKEDIN_TAG_ID                public Insight Tag partner ID
LINKEDIN_ACCOUNT_URN           urn:li:sponsoredAccount:<id>
LINKEDIN_CAPI_TOKEN             server-only direct or OAuth bearer token
LINKEDIN_CAPI_CONVERSION_URN    urn:lla:llaPartnerConversion:<id>
LINKEDIN_INSIGHT_CONVERSION_ID  browser conversion rule ID
LINKEDIN_VERSION                value for the Linkedin-Version header
```
## Client-side Insight Tag

Create the tag under **Data → Signals Manager → Insight Tag**. Copy its partner
ID. Load it on every eligible page in the global footer, just before `</body>`.
See [Insight Tag conversion tracking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/conversion-tracking?view=li-lms-2026-08).

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  _linkedin_partner_id = "<LINKEDIN_TAG_ID>";
  window._linkedin_data_partner_ids = window._linkedin_data_partner_ids || [];
  window._linkedin_data_partner_ids.push(_linkedin_partner_id);
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function (l) {
    if (!l) {
      window.lintrk = function (a, b) { window.lintrk.q.push([a, b]); };
      window.lintrk.q = [];
    }
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
    var b = document.createElement("script");
    b.type = "text/javascript"; b.async = true;
    b.src = "https://snap.licdn.com/li.lms-analytics/insight.min.js";
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(b, s);
  })(window.lintrk);
</script>
<noscript><img height="1" width="1" style="display:none" alt=""
  src="https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=<LINKEDIN_TAG_ID>&fmt=gif" /></noscript>
```

For a page-load conversion, set the shared ID before the base tag:

```html
<script>window._linkedin_event_id = "<CANONICAL_EVENT_ID>";</script>
```

For an event-specific conversion, pass the same ID to `lintrk`:

```js
window.lintrk("track", {
  conversion_id: "<LINKEDIN_INSIGHT_CONVERSION_ID>",
  event_id: canonicalEvent.event_id,
});
```
## Rule setup and event mapping

The streaming payload has no free-form event name. The conversion rule's
`type` supplies the LinkedIn event name. Create a rule per type. Use separate
browser and server rules when you enable deduplication.

| Hub event | LinkedIn rule type | Send when |
|---|---|---|
| `page_view` | `KEY_PAGE_VIEW` | Important page only |
| `view_content` | `VIEW_CONTENT` | Meaningful product or plan view |
| `lead` | `LEAD` | Qualified lead submission |
| `signup` | `SIGN_UP` or `COMPLETE_SIGNUP` | Account or registration completes |
| `begin_checkout` | `START_CHECKOUT` | Checkout starts |
| `purchase` | `PURCHASE` | Payment provider confirms a charge |
| `subscription_start` | `SUBSCRIBE` | Paid subscription activates |
| `refund` | Do not dispatch | Reconcile with payment truth |

These types are in the [CAPI schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/conversions-api-schema?view=li-lms-2026-08). LinkedIn documents no `REFUND` type.

Create a CAPI rule:

```http
POST https://api.linkedin.com/rest/conversions?autoAssociationType=ALL_CAMPAIGNS
Authorization: Bearer <LINKEDIN_CAPI_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
Linkedin-Version: <LINKEDIN_VERSION>
X-Restli-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0
```

```json
{
  "name": "CAPI purchase",
  "account": "urn:li:sponsoredAccount:<ACCOUNT_ID>",
  "conversionMethod": "CONVERSIONS_API",
  "postClickAttributionWindowSize": 90,
  "viewThroughAttributionWindowSize": 30,
  "attributionType": "LAST_TOUCH_BY_CAMPAIGN",
  "type": "PURCHASE"
}
```

Save the returned ID as `urn:lla:llaPartnerConversion:<id>`. Without automatic
association, use the Campaign Conversions API or Campaign Manager UI. LinkedIn
only attributes to associated campaigns. See [Conversions API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/conversions-api?view=li-lms-2026-08).

## Server-side Conversions API

Send the confirmed event to `POST https://api.linkedin.com/rest/conversionEvents`
with the same bearer and version headers above:

```json
{
  "conversion": "urn:lla:llaPartnerConversion:<CONVERSION_ID>",
  "conversionHappenedAt": 1730017211229,
  "conversionValue": { "currencyCode": "USD", "amount": "25.00" },
  "user": { "userIds": [
    { "idType": "SHA256_EMAIL", "idValue": "<SHA256_EMAIL_HEX>" },
    { "idType": "LINKEDIN_FIRST_PARTY_ADS_TRACKING_UUID", "idValue": "<LI_FAT_ID>" }
  ]},
  "eventId": "<CANONICAL_EVENT_ID>"
}
```

`conversion`, `conversionHappenedAt`, and `user` are the event fields. The
timestamp is epoch milliseconds and must be within 90 days. The value amount is
a decimal string. At least one valid identity is required unless another valid
user field supplies identity. A successful single event returns `201 Created`.
See [the event schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/conversions-api-schema?view=li-lms-2026-08).

Batch requests use `X-RestLi-Method: BATCH_CREATE` and allow 5,000 events. Use
the hub's bounded retry and dead-letter policy. Do not replay an uncertain
request unless the dispatch record and `eventId` rule make it safe. See [CAPI FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/conversions/conversions-faq?view=li-lms-2026-08).

## Identity and consent

- Require `measurement: true` in the hub before any LinkedIn event.
- Require `ad_user_data: true` before hashed email, IP, or external IDs.
- Remove email whitespace, lowercase it, then SHA-256 hash it. Send lowercase
  hexadecimal text. Do not hash an existing hash again.
- Supported IDs include `SHA256_EMAIL`, `LINKEDIN_FIRST_PARTY_ADS_TRACKING_UUID`,
  `ACXIOM_ID`, `PLAINTEXT_IP_ADDRESS`, `SHA256_IP_ADDRESS`, and `GOOGLE_AID`.
- Plain and hashed IP IDs support IPv4 only. `userInfo` is plain text and needs
  both `firstName` and `lastName`. `externalIds` accepts one advertiser ID.
- LinkedIn preserves a matched external-ID mapping for one year across ad
  accounts in the same Business Manager. Pair it with a standard ID first.

The hub owns normalization and consent. LinkedIn also prohibits the Insight Tag
on pages that collect sensitive health or financial data. See [privacy guidance](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a515671).

## Click ID and first-party cookie

Enable **Enhanced conversion tracking** for the Insight Tag. LinkedIn then adds
`li_fat_id` to ad landing URLs. Capture it on first landing and persist first-
touch and latest values in first-party storage. The cookie lasts 30 days from
the latest qualifying ad click. Send it to CAPI as
`LINKEDIN_FIRST_PARTY_ADS_TRACKING_UUID`. Parsing only the URL can limit view-
through attribution; reading the cookie supports it. Do not require a click ID
before sending a server purchase. See [Enabling Click IDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/conversions/enabling-first-party-cookies?view=li-lms-2026-08).

New tags enable first-party tracking by default. Check
`firstPartyTrackingEnabled` when the cookie or `li_fat_id` is absent. Campaign
Manager and the partial update API can change this setting.

## Deduplication

LinkedIn reconciles browser and server copies with `eventId`.

1. Create a browser Insight Tag rule and a server CAPI rule for the action.
2. Put the same hub `event_id` in browser `event_id` and server `eventId`.
3. Set `_linkedin_event_id` before the page-load tag, or pass `event_id` to
   `lintrk` for an event-specific conversion.
4. Check both conversion breakdowns. For the same account and ID, LinkedIn
   counts the Insight Tag copy and discards the CAPI twin.

See [LinkedIn deduplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/conversions/deduplication?view=li-lms-2026-08). The event ID is not the conversion rule URN.

## Campaign Manager settings that override code

- `enabled=false` stops a rule from matching events.
- `conversionMethod` must be `CONVERSIONS_API` for server rules.
- No campaign association means no campaign attribution.
- The rule controls attribution windows and model. Current CAPI defaults are
  30 days post-click and 7 days view-through. Supported windows include 1, 7,
  30, and 90 days; 365 days is limited to some types.
- `DYNAMIC`, `FIXED`, and `NO_VALUE` control reported conversion value.
- A blocked Insight Tag domain sends no downstream conversion or audience signal.
- Website Actions can create conversions that stay inactive until approved.

See [rule settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/conversions-api-schema?view=li-lms-2026-08) and [Website Actions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a1441293?lang=en-US).

## Verification

1. **Request proof:** record the redacted event response. `201 Created` proves
   request acceptance, not attribution.
2. **Platform proof:** in Campaign Manager, open **Measurement → Conversion
   Tracking**. Check the CAPI rule status and match rate. `Active` with a good
   match rate shows receipt and identity matching. `Low Match Rate` shows poor
   identity matching. Read active CAPI rules with `GET /rest/conversions`,
   filtering `enabled=true` and `conversionMethod=CONVERSIONS_API`.
3. **Business proof:** open **Conversions & Leads**, break down by conversion,
   and reconcile counts and value with succeeded charges.

For the tag, query `GET https://api.linkedin.com/rest/insightTagDomains?q=account&account=<ENCODED_ACCOUNT_URN>`. Domains can take 5–10 minutes to populate after a visit. See [tag verification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/conversion-tracking?view=li-lms-2026-08) and [CAPI measurement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/conversions/conversions-usecase?view=li-lms-2026-08).

## Common pitfalls and security

- Use `urn:li:sponsoredAccount:<id>` for the account and
  `urn:lla:llaPartnerConversion:<id>` for the rule.
- Use epoch milliseconds, not seconds. Use `eventId`, not `event_id`, in CAPI.
- Do not send raw email, an uppercase hash, or a double-hashed email.
- Do not create a new browser and server ID for one event.
- Do not send only `li_fat_id`; organic and direct events still matter.
- Do not treat `201`, a live tag request, or an active campaign as attribution.
- Recheck rule status, domain status, campaign association, member role, and
  `rw_conversions`/`r_ads` after any access change.
- Keep `LINKEDIN_CAPI_TOKEN` server-side. Never put it in browser code, URLs,
  logs, screenshots, or commits. Use HTTPS, redact bearer tokens, apply the hub
  consent gate, and delete temporary normalized identifiers after dispatch.

# Building an Airtable extension

An Airtable extension is a **React app that runs inside a base**, built on the **Airtable Blocks SDK** (`@airtable/blocks`, UI from `@airtable/blocks/ui`). Source conventionally lives in `frontend/`. It reads the base's tables/records and calls your own backend. Command-level playbook: `pooriaarab/scripts` `scripts/airtable-extension/README.md`.

## The trap that 404s your whole install: there is NO `@airtable/blocks-ui`

The UI components (`Button`, `Input`, `initializeBlock`, …) come from the **`@airtable/blocks/ui` subpath of the single `@airtable/blocks` package** — NOT a separate `@airtable/blocks-ui` npm package. Adding `@airtable/blocks-ui` to `dependencies` makes `npm install` fail with a **404**, which installs *nothing* (including `@airtable/blocks`), and every import then reports "Cannot find module `@airtable/blocks`." One phantom dependency breaks the entire build. Depend on `@airtable/blocks` only; import UI from `@airtable/blocks/ui`.

## The other traps

1. **React 16/17, not 18.** The Blocks SDK targets React 16/17. Mount the standalone/dev shell with `ReactDOM.render(<App/>, el)` — `import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"` (React 18) fails to resolve against the pinned React 17. Inside Airtable, mount via `initializeBlock(() => <App/>)` from `@airtable/blocks/ui`, not your own root.
2. **`frontend/`, not `src/`.** The Blocks toolchain expects the code under `frontend/`; a tsconfig `include` pointing at `src` typechecks nothing.
3. **`block.json`** carries the block identity; keep it, it's what `block run`/`block release` use.
4. **globalConfig for config, not localStorage** — persist the API key + table mapping in `globalConfig` (shared per-installation), and gate on `hasPermission` before writes.

## Build path

- `frontend/index.tsx` boots: try `initializeBlock` (real Airtable), else `ReactDOM.render` (standalone dev).
- Build: `tsc --noEmit && vite build` (or the block CLI). Depend on `@airtable/blocks` + `react@^17`/`react-dom@^17`.
- Read the content-calendar table, map a row → your API create call (`platformType` string), write status/id/url back to the row.

## Submission — Airtable

**Submittable: hybrid — CLI uploads code, a web form + human review does the rest.** `block release` (deploy a private build to your own bases) and `block submit` (public marketplace) are **independent** — you do NOT need to release or have prior usage first. Steps:
1. `npm install --global @airtable/blocks-cli`; the CLI authenticates with your Airtable **personal access token** (set at CLI init — this part is automatable).
2. From the extension dir, run **`block submit`** — it bundles + uploads the code, then **prints a per-submission web-form URL**.
3. Open that link (a **logged-in Airtable browser session** — not scriptable) and fill the listing.
4. Airtable reviews (a few days–weeks) and emails revisions/approval. Updates = `block submit` again; approved installs auto-update.

**Required assets:** square **icon 200×200–1000×1000**; publisher name + publisher icon (same range); one-sentence short description + a multi-paragraph long one; **1–10 screenshots, min 300×500, max 1800px wide** (must match the real UI); optional demo video; **support email + URL**; and **required privacy policy + terms-of-service URLs** (a hard gate). Reviewer-only (required): install/usage instructions, a full-feature **walkthrough video**, and a **read-only invite to an example base**.

**Credentials — how to obtain / self-serve?** The CLI upload needs your **Airtable personal access token** (create at airtable.com/create/tokens — you make it, then I can run `block submit`). The listing form + review assets need YOU in a logged-in browser; I can't create the account or author the screenshots/example base.

**Silent-rejection gotchas:** stale/fake screenshots vs real UI; bugs on primary flows; over-specific table/field-name requirements (must generalize to any base); unnecessary data access/network calls; any CSP violation or dynamic code execution (no eval/Function/Web Workers); thin support docs; ads; **missing privacy policy / ToS**; plus the build traps above (`@airtable/blocks-ui` 404, React-18 mount).

## Parity checklist (prove in a real base)

paste + validate the API key (globalConfig) · pick the calendar table · a row → a scheduled post (`platformType`) · write status back · list posts · read analytics.

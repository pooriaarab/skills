# Mac on Windows

Use when someone works primarily on a Mac and wants a Windows machine to stop
fighting their muscle memory — usually a second desktop, a work-issued PC, or a
box driven over a software KVM.

## Triggers

- "make Windows behave like a Mac", "Mac keyboard shortcuts on Windows"
- "Cmd+C doesn't work", "I keep hitting the wrong key"
- "Magic Trackpad gestures on Windows", "three-finger swipe"
- "Spotlight on Windows", "Quick Look on Windows"

## Phase 0 — Detect the input topology first

Everything downstream depends on **which physical key the Mac's Command lands
on**, and that cannot be guessed. Three topologies produce three different
answers:

| Topology | Command arrives as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Apple keyboard paired directly to Windows, no Boot Camp drivers | **Win** | Option lands on Alt |
| Apple keyboard with Boot Camp / Magicoft drivers | often **Alt** | drivers swap Cmd/Option to match PC layout |
| Mac drives Windows over Deskflow / Synergy / Barrier | **Win** | KVM maps Cmd → super → `VK_LWIN` |

Detect it rather than assuming:

```powershell
# Is a KVM client running here?
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name like 'deskflow%' or Name like 'synergy%'" |
    Select-Object Name, CommandLine
# 'client' in the command line means the keyboard is on the OTHER machine.

# What input hardware is actually attached?
Get-PnpDevice -PresentOnly |
    Where-Object { $_.Class -in 'Keyboard','Mouse','HIDClass' -and $_.FriendlyName -match 'Apple|Magic' }
```

If no Apple hardware is present locally but a KVM client is running, the Mac is
upstream and **Command arrives as Win**.

Confirm before writing a keymap. A one-line AutoHotkey probe settles it:

```ahk
#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0
~*LWin::ToolTip "Win"
~*LAlt::ToolTip "Alt"
```

## Phase 1 — The keymap

Map Command from **Win**, and leave **Ctrl and Alt untouched**. This is the
choice that makes everything else fall into place:

- a locally attached PC keyboard keeps behaving like normal Windows
- Ctrl becomes genuinely free, so it can carry macOS's system-wide emacs text
  navigation (`Ctrl+A/E/B/F/N/P/D/H/K`) — which is exactly how a Mac splits the
  two modifiers

A working, commented implementation lives at
[`pooriaarab/scripts/scripts/mac-keys-windows`](https://github.com/pooriaarab/scripts/tree/main/scripts/mac-keys-windows).
Prefer it over PowerToys Keyboard Manager, which is not context-aware and will
happily break Alt+Tab and terminal keys with a blanket swap.

Generate the bulk of the bindings rather than hand-writing 40 hotkeys:

```ahk
Pass(keys) => Send("{Blind}{LWin up}{RWin up}" keys)   ; drop Win, keep Shift
CmdOf(t)   => (*) => Pass("^" t)
for key in StrSplit("abdefgijklnoprstuwxyz1234567890,./;=-")
    try Hotkey("*#" key, CmdOf(key))
```

`{Blind}` is what makes one hotkey per key sufficient: it preserves a
physically-held Shift, so `Cmd+Shift+Z` arrives as `Ctrl+Shift+Z` for free.

**Exclude terminals from the Ctrl bindings.** Check the active process against a
list and bail out — `Ctrl+C` must stay an interrupt, `Ctrl+A` is the tmux
prefix. Inside terminals map `Cmd+C`/`Cmd+V` to `Ctrl+Shift+C`/`Ctrl+Shift+V`,
which is the same trick Terminal.app plays.

## Phase 2 — The rest of the desktop

| macOS | Windows |
|---|---|
| Spotlight | PowerToys Run — read its hotkey from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\PowerToys\PowerToys Run\settings.json` (`open_powerlauncher`) and relay Cmd+Space to it, rather than editing PowerToys config |
| Quick Look | QuickLook (`winget install QL-Win.QuickLook`) — spacebar preview, no configuration needed |
| Mission Control | `Win+Tab`, bound to `Ctrl+Up` |
| Spaces | `Win+Ctrl+←/→`, bound to `Ctrl+←/→` |
| Screenshots | `Win+PrintScreen`, `Win+Shift+S`, `Win+Alt+R` |
| Finder | the Files app, or Explorer with QuickLook |

Skip macOS *theming*. The credible options are paid (Stardock Curtains) or deep
shell hooks (MyDockFinder), and UxTheme patchers break on Windows updates. Say
so rather than installing one unasked.

## Phase 3 — Trackpad gestures, and their real ceiling

This is where expectations need managing early. **A software KVM forwards mouse
motion, buttons, scroll and clipboard — not multi-touch.** Deskflow, Synergy and
Barrier all interpret gestures on the machine the trackpad is attached to. A
three-finger swipe on a Mac-attached Magic Trackpad triggers Mission Control *on
the Mac* and nothing crosses the wire.

There are exactly two ways forward, and they are mutually exclusive:

**A. Pair the Magic Trackpad directly to Windows.** Install
[mac-precision-touchpad](https://github.com/imbushuo/mac-precision-touchpad),
which exposes a Magic Trackpad 2 as a Windows Precision Touchpad. Real
multi-touch: two-finger scroll, pinch zoom, three-finger swipe for Task View and
app switching, four-finger for Spaces, all configurable under
Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Touchpad. This is the only path to something
close to full parity. Costs: the trackpad now drives Windows only, Bluetooth
pairs to one host at a time, and the driver is community-signed so installation
needs an explicit trust prompt.

**B. Keep the trackpad on the Mac and relay gestures as keystrokes.** Use
BetterTouchTool on the Mac to bind each gesture to a keyboard shortcut, which
the KVM forwards like any other key, and map that shortcut on the Windows side.
Discrete gestures only — three-finger swipes work, continuous ones (pinch zoom,
smooth swipe tracking) do not, because there is no gesture stream to interpolate.

Do not promise parity through a KVM. Establish which of A or B the user wants
before building anything, because they imply different hardware setups.

## Gotchas

- **`Win+L` cannot be hooked.** Windows reserves it below any keyboard hook, so
  `Cmd+L` locks the screen instead of focusing the address bar. The only fix is
  `DisableLockWorkstation=1` under
  `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`. Offer it as
  an opt-in and move locking to `Cmd+Ctrl+Q`, the real macOS shortcut.
- **AutoHotkey's `AltTab` action takes exactly one L/R-qualified modifier.**
  `#Tab::AltTab` fails with *"must specify which key (L or R)"*;
  `<#<+Tab::ShiftAltTab` fails with *"must have exactly one modifier/prefix"*.
  Spell out `<#Tab` and `>#Tab`, and drive the reverse direction by hand:

  ```ahk
  *#+Tab:: {
      if GetKeyState("Alt")                        ; switcher already open
          Send "{Blind}{LWin up}{RWin up}{Tab}"    ; Shift held -> backwards
      else
          Send "{LWin up}{RWin up}{Shift up}!+{Tab}"
  }
  ```

- **A backtick hotkey needs a scan code.** Backtick is AutoHotkey's escape
  character, so `Cmd+\`` must be written `#SC029`.
- **`/validate` is not a v2.0 switch.** Passing it runs the script instead of
  checking it. To verify a load, launch it, wait, and look for a `#32770`
  dialog owned by the AutoHotkey process; `PrintWindow` captures the message
  even when the dialog is behind another window.
- **Scroll direction through a KVM is already inverted.** macOS applies natural
  scrolling before the KVM forwards the delta, so Windows usually receives the
  right direction. The `FlipFlopWheel` registry trick will not help either way —
  it acts on HID drivers, and KVM input is injected. Provide a runtime toggle.
- **Ship a panic switch.** A global keymap that misfires is unusable and
  un-fixable by keyboard. Bind suspend to a combination that survives the remap
  (`Ctrl+Alt+F12`) and expose it in the tray menu.

## What is genuinely unavailable

The global menu bar, and app-level `Cmd+Q` quit semantics — Windows closes
windows, it has no concept of a running app with no windows. Say this up front
instead of approximating it badly.
